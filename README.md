## Podcaster - Backend
Quack is an interactive website that gives users a fun and easy solution to group communication. Users can send and received messages in real time with auto-updating individualized chatrooms. Past messages are stored server side on the backend API so that you will never have to worry about forgetting a conversation. With included timestamps and metadata, simply login and return to your chatroom to see what everyone was chatting about while you were gone.
